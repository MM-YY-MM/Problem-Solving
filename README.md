# ðŸ“Œ Problem-Solving

**This is my problem-solving repository.**  

**I use it to demonstrate practical applications at different levels.**  

**For each level, I highlight the key concepts you were exposed to at that stage, without going too deep into details.**

## ðŸ”¹ Levels Overview

- **LV1 (Foundations):**  
  Starting point â€” solving the very first problems and learning the basics of C++ step by step.

- **LV2 (Reinforcement):**  
  Repeating and practicing more problems at the same beginner level to build confidence and strengthen the foundations.

- **LV3 (Expansion):**  
  Moving beyond the basics â€” exploring intermediate concepts such as pointers, recursion, file handling, and matrices.  

Each level is a snapshot of the stage I was in, showing **how the skills evolved naturally from simple to more complex problems**.
