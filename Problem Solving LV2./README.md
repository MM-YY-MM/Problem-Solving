# 🧩 Problem-Solving-LV2  
Problem-solving challenges of the same first level — but with different sets of problems.  

---

## 📌 Description  
This repository continues my documentation and practice of problem-solving challenges at the first level.  
It does not represent a step up in complexity but rather **another collection of problems of the same level**.  

👉 **LV1 = the starting point.**  
👉 **LV2 = reinforcement and more practice at the same level.**  

The idea is to strengthen and solidify the foundations further by solving more exercises of the same type.  
This stage is about **reinforcement through practice** — repeating, experimenting, and refining problem-solving skills.

## 📝 Concepts Reinforced  
During this level, I kept practicing and revisiting the same fundamental concepts from LV1, including:  

- **Syntax & Output**: printing outputs, handling newlines, working with namespaces, using comments.  
- **Basic Building Blocks**: literals, variables, naming rules, user inputs, data types.  
- **Operators**: arithmetic, assignment, relational, logical, increment/decrement.  
- **Math Functions**: sqrt, pow, ceil, floor, abs, and others.  
- **Data Structures**: structures, enums, nested structures and enums.  
- **Type Conversion**: stoi, stof, stod, to_string.  
- **Strings**: string manipulation and basic operations.  
- **Functions**: defining and calling functions, scope, parameters, reusability, passing by value/reference.  
- **Arrays**: one-dimensional arrays and arrays with functions.  
- **Conditional Statements**: if/else, switch/case, enums in conditionals.  
- **Loops**: for, while, do…while, nested loops.  
- **Control Statements**: break, continue.
