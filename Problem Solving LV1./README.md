# 🧩 Problem-Solving-LV1
Problem-solving challenges of the first level — the starting point of my journey.

📌 Description
--------------

This repository is dedicated to documenting and solving **problem-solving challenges of the first level**.  
It represents the stage I have currently reached in practicing and improving my programming skills.

At this point, I am focusing on strengthening my foundation through first-level problems.  
I honestly don’t know what lies ahead or how the journey will evolve, but this is the **starting point** —  
a space where I try, make mistakes, learn, and gradually improve.

📝 Concepts Learned  
--------------

During this level, I was exposed to and practiced the following concepts:  

- **Syntax & Output**: print (output), omitting namespace (`std::`), `\n` or `endl`, comments.  
- **Basic Building Blocks**: literals and escape sequences, variables and naming rules, user inputs, data types (sizes & ranges).  
- **Operators**: arithmetic operators, increment/decrement (`++`, `--`), postfix vs prefix, assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`), relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).  
- **Math Functions**: square root, rounding, power, `ceil`, `floor`, absolute value.  
- **Data Structures**: structures, enums, nested structures and enums (full practical examples).  
- **Type Conversion**: `stoi`, `stof`, `stod`, `to_string`.  
- **Strings**: string handling and manipulation.  
- **Functions**:  
  - Part 1 — basic functions.  
  - Solving the `getline()` problem.  
  - Part 2 — functions vs procedures.  
  - Part 3 — parameters, variable scope (local vs global), by-value vs by-reference, re-usability and function with structures.  
- **Arrays**: arrays, arrays with functions.  
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `if ... else`, `else if`, enums with if statements, `switch ... case`, nested functions with enums.  
- **Loops**:  
  - `for` loop, for loop with arrays, nested for loops.  
  - `while` loop.  
  - `do ... while` loop.  
- **Control Statements**: `break`, `continue`.
